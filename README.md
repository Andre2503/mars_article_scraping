# Mars Data Scraping and Analysis

Welcome to the Mars Data Scraping and Analysis repository. This project showcases the application of web scraping techniques to extract data about Mars' articles and the subsequent analysis of the weather conditions on Mars.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to harness web scraping techniques using Splinter and Beautiful Soup to extract relevant data about Mars, specifically news titles and preview text as well as comprehensive weather data. Following the extraction, the weather data undergoes a detailed analysis to derive insights about Martian conditions.

## File Descriptions

1. `README.md`: 
   - This file provides an overview of the repository and guides on how to use it.
   
2. `mars_data.csv`: 
   - A CSV file containing the summarized data scraped from the Mars website. It encompasses various weather parameters over different Martian sols and months.
   
3. `part_1_mars_news.ipynb`: 
   - This Jupyter notebook contains the code and methodology to scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

4. `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`: 
   - This Jupyter notebook delves into the scraping of Mars weather data and its subsequent analysis. Insights about temperature variations, atmospheric pressure, and other related aspects of Martian weather are derived within this notebook.

## How to Use

1. **Setting Up**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed: `pandas`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `splinter`.

2. **Executing the Notebooks**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the notebooks.
   - Run `jupyter notebook` and open the desired notebook (`part_1_mars_news.ipynb` or `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`).
   - Execute the cells in sequence to scrape and/or analyze the data.

3. **Viewing the Data**:
   - Open `mars_data.csv` to view the scraped Martian weather data in a tabular format.
